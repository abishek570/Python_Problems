# Python Problems

A curated collection of Python solutions for coding practice and algorithm implementations. This repository contains solutions sourced from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, along with standalone implementations of classic algorithms and data structures.

## Highlights
- **Sources:** Problems and exercises drawn from LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.
- **Algorithms:** Implementations of common algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, etc.) and basic data-structure utilities.
- **Organization:** Code is organized into topic and difficulty-based folders for easy navigation and practice.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer

## Usage
- Run individual scripts from the command line, for example:

  ```bash
  python Python\ Problems/Basic\ Problems/some_script.py
  ```

- Open files in an editor to read explanations, inspect implementations, and run examples.

## Contributing
- Contributions, fixes, and improvements are welcome. Please open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
